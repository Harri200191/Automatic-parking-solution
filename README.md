The project was created to provide a parking solution on the command line. No GUI was used here. Generally, the project was divided into 2 distinct parts; the app and the actual parking allocation. Users can update their wallet, from where money can be deducted each time they park. Moreover, the application works real time to provide accurate functionality. 

Moving on, there is also an option for the user to become a member through 2 distinct memberhsip plans that provide a free parking against set parameters. The application can be used as many times as required.
